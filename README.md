# PWA Text Editor

## Description

AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

GIVEN a text editor web application
WHEN I open my application in my editor
THEN I should see a client server folder structure

WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client

WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack

WHEN I run my webpack plugins
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file

WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors

WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage

WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB

WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB

WHEN I click on the Install button
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop

WHEN I load my web application
THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox

WHEN I register a service worker
THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets

WHEN I deploy to Heroku
THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
